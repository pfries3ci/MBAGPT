                    YOU, AS A BUSINESS, UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL FORMS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AS THE BUSINESS AND YOUR CUSTOMERS MAY REQUIRE SPECIFIC CUSTOMER CONSENT TO TRANSMIT SUCH COMMUNICATION; THIS INCLUDES YOUR USE OF THE REVIEW SOLUTION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CERTAIN STATUTES AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING AND WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1991 AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER (THE "TCPA"), MAY GOVERN USE OF THE REVIEW SOLUTION.

                    IN UTILIZING THE REVIEW SOLUTION, YOU POSITIVELY AFFIRM THAT YOUR BUSINESS HAS OBTAINED AFFIRMATIVE VERBAL OR WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT FROM THE CUSTOMER TO SEND THE REVIEW SOLUTION COMMUNICATIONS TO THE DESIGNATED NUMBER AND/OR EMAIL ADDRESS AT WHICH THE CUSTOMER INDICATED THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE THE CONTENT.

                    IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH TCPA GUIDELINES, YOU MUST ASK YOUR CUSTOMERS FOR PERMISSION TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES. BE CLEAR ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF TEXTS AND THE TYPE OF MESSAGE(S) THEY WILL RECEIVE.
